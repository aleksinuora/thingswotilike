# Things Wot I like
## tracking the newest releases from your favorite creators

### Motivation

This started as a personal project. I wanted a single page that tracks
information on the newest films, television shows, albums etc. from 
selected creators. But then I figured I might as well get some study
credits from the Full Stack Open MOOC.

### Implementation

Backend:
* Python
* FastAPI
* MongoDB

Frontend:
* JavaScript
* Preact

Why Python instead of Node? For the sake of having more practice with
Python backends.
